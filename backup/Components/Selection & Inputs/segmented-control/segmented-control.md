## Usage

* Segmented control allow users to toggle between alternate views of similar or related content, showing only one content section at a time.
* Should be used to change the way a piece of content or data is formatted on the page. It doesn't trigger changes to the content or data itself.
* The main action of a button group will be in selected mode.



>🤓 **Am I using the right component?** : Keep the content short and actionable. For longer content, use the Select component.
