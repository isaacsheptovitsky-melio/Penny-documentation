## Usage

**Separating sections**: Use dividers to create a clear boundary between distinct groups of information, such as separating "Vendor details" from "Payment method" in a workflow.

>🤓 **Tip**: Use dividers sparingly. Overusing them can create visual clutter. Generous whitespace is enough to separate related content.
