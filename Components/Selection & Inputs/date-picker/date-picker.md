## Usage

* When clicked, the Date picker triggers displays the Calendar component
* Upon date selection, the Calendar component is hidden, and the chosen date is set in the input field

>⚠️ The Date Picker component is optional. The Date Field component already serves as an effective trigger for date selection, making the Date Picker unnecessary in most cases.
