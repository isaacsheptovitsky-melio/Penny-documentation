A Split Button provides a primary, default action while also grouping a set of secondary, related actions into a dropdown menu.


## Usage

Use the Split Button to **provide a closely-related option** without complicating the primary user flow. Some examples: 

### Example #1

Primary action: "Save" 

* Secondary action: "Save as Template"

### Example #2

Primary action: "Create bill" 

* Secondary action: "Import from spreadsheet"
* Secondary action: "Add from Gmail"

>🤓 **Tip**: Make the default action predictable, users shouldn't have to open the dropdown menu to understand the component's primary function.
