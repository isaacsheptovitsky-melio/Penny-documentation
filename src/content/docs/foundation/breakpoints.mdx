Breakpoints represent how the screen resolution is broken down so we could support the responsiveness of the application across different devices.

## Usage

- **Apply spacing tokens** for margins, paddings, layout gaps, grid gutters, etc.
- **Avoid arbitrary pixel values** unless justified by a special case.
- Use **larger tokens** to separate sections or create breathing room.
- Use **smaller tokens** inside compact components or dense UI areas.

## Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Range           | Device              |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| xs         | 0px - 599px     | Mobile              |
| s          | 600px - 904px   | Mobile in landscape |
| m          | 905px - 1239px  | Tablet              |
| l          | 1240px - 1439px | Laptop              |
| xl         | < 1440px        | Desktop             |

<Aside type="note">
  📌 We primarily design for two device types: mobile and desktop. Our main
  breakpoint is 1240px, meaning that at 1239px and below, components and layouts
  adapt to a mobile-friendly format.

## Container width

<Aside type="note" title="🖥️ Max width behavior">
  The max-width setting allows containers to expand up to the specified width
  (e.g., 900px) when there is enough space. For example, a container with a
  max-width of 900px will grow to fill the screen but will stop expanding once
  it reaches 900px.

*Expanding the viewport to let the container increase in width, up to its maximum
width of 900px.*
