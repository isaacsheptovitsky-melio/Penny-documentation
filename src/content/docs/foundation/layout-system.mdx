Layouts are here to help with the **structure** and alignment of elements within a design, ensuring a **consistent** experience.

We strive to offer the best layout for each screen's function, addressing various user needs:

- **Creating** new entities and information
- **Reading**, or consuming, information
- **Updating**, or editing, information
- **Deleting** information
