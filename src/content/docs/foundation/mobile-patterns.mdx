This page outlines Melio's mobile UI patterns and adaptations; How core components and layouts transition from desktop to mobile, ensuring consistency, usability, and responsiveness across viewports.

## Core principles

Our mobile adaptations are rooted in [Penny's values and principles](https://zeroheight.com/98bb1df01/p/96fdb6)—**Scalability**, **Efficiency**, and **Quality**—and guided by the actionable principles of being **Consistent**, **Accessible**, and **Flexible**.

## Prioritize key actions

Surface primary actions and deprioritize secondary ones using clear hierarchy and strategic placement

  **⚙️ Efficiency**
</Aside>

  />
</div>

_Drawer actions are simplified into two buttons: Pay as the primary action, and all additional actions grouped under the More button._

## Progressive disclosure

Simplify layouts by progressively disclosing content with drawer—supporting a range of user needs.

  **🧰 Scalability**
</Aside>

  />
</div>

_Table row information is condensed into key highlights; tapping a row reveals additional details in a drawer._

## Adapt to viewport

Adjust screen usage by hiding non-essential elements to maximize space when the experience requires it.

<Aside type="note" title="Principle">
  **⛑️ Quality**
</Aside>

<div class="image-container">
  <img
    src="/Penny-documentation/foundation/assets/mobile-patterns-image-3.png"
  />
</div>

_The combobox is triggered by a tap, rather than focus, and opens in full screen, allowing simultaneous keyboard input and option browsing._

## Preserve focus and context

Ensure seamless transitions and focus management to maintain user orientation, particularly in overlays and nested flows.

<Aside type="note" title="Principle">
  **🌍 Accessible**
</Aside>

<div class="image-container">
  <img
    src="/Penny-documentation/foundation/assets/mobile-patterns-image-4.png"
  />
</div>

_Focus is directed to the relevant content, even when a side sheet is opened._

## Optimize for touch

Increase target sizes, respect thumb reach zones, and ensure predictable interactions across all components.

  **⚖️ Consistent**

<div class="image-container">

    alt="Button width"
  />
</div>

**Button width**

## Design for growth

Create mobile patterns that work across brands, screen sizes, and use cases, supporting partner theming and future expansion.

> Principle: **🤸 Flexible**

<div class="image-container">

  />
</div>

_The Delete bill dialog appears as a bottom sheet rather than a modal._

## Use cases

For details on each component's mobile guidelines and behavior, visit its dedicated documentation page:

- [Button](/components/action/button/)
- [Combobox](/components/selection-inputs/combobox/)
- [Drawer](/components/containers/drawer/)
- [Modal](/components/containers/modal/)
- [Menus](/components/containers/menus/)
- [Panel](/components/containers/panel/)
- [Section banner](/components/data-display/section-banner/)
- [Side sheet](/components/containers/base-sheet/)
- Table (TBD)
