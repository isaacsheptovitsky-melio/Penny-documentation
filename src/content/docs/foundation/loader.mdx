## Usage

Use the Loader component when:

- A page or section of the UI is awaiting data
- A user-initiated action triggers a delay (e.g., submitting a form or fetching data)
- It's important to reassure users that the system is actively working

## Specifications

You can customize the Loader's color using any color from the Penny palette; by default, it uses `brand.700` .

## Examples

The Loader is used in two scenarios: when a screen is waiting for data to load, and when an asynchronous action is in progress.

## Screen data loading

Saving or paying a bill is an asynchronous action that requires a server response for confirmation.

## Async action

## Accessibility

By default, the loader component uses an aria-label of "Loading…", which will be announced by screen readers. You can override this text to announce a custom message if needed by setting the `loadingText`attribute.
