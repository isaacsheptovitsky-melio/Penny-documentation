Spaces are size tokens used throughout the design system to define consistent spacing - including padding, margin, gaps, and more.

## Usage

- **Apply spacing tokens** for margins, paddings, layout gaps, grid gutters, etc.
- **Avoid arbitrary pixel values** unless justified by a special case.
- Use **larger tokens** to separate sections or create breathing room.
- Use **smaller tokens** inside compact components or dense UI areas.

## Spaces tokens

| `spacing.none` | 0px | Used to reset spacing or eliminate gaps |
| `spacing.xxxs` | 2px | — |
| `spacing.xxs` | 4px | Used in spacing small, related elements, usually within a component, such as Pill. |
| `spacing.xs` | 8px | Commonly used between form elements, icons, and label gaps, and as padding for extra-small components like Tooltips and Pills. |
| `spacing.xs-s` | 12px | Used as vertical padding for smaller components such as Inputs. |
