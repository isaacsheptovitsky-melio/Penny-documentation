# Mobile patterns

This page outlines Melio's mobile UI patterns and adaptations; How core components and layouts transition from desktop to mobile, ensuring consistency, usability, and responsiveness across viewports.


# Core principles

Our mobile adaptations are rooted in [Penny's values and principles](https://zeroheight.com/98bb1df01/p/96fdb6)—**Scalability**, **Efficiency**, and **Quality**—and guided by the actionable principles of being **Consistent**, **Accessible**, and **Flexible**.

## Prioritize key actions

Surface primary actions and deprioritize secondary ones using clear hierarchy and strategic placement

>Value: **⚙️ Efficiency**

|   | ![](/Penny-documentation/foundation/assets/mobile-patterns-image-1.png)*Drawer actions are simplified into two buttons: Pay as the primary action, and all additional actions grouped under the More button.* |   |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Progressive disclosure

Simplify layouts by progressively disclosing content with drawer—supporting a range of user needs.

>Value: **🧰 Scalability**

|   | ![](/Penny-documentation/foundation/assets/mobile-patterns-image-2.png)*Table row information is condensed into key highlights; tapping a row reveals additional details in a drawer.* |   |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Adapt to viewport

Adjust screen usage by hiding non-essential elements to maximize space when the experience requires it.

>Principle: **⛑️ Quality**

|   | ![](/Penny-documentation/foundation/assets/mobile-patterns-image-3.png)*The combobox is triggered by a tap, rather than focus, and opens in full screen, allowing simultaneous keyboard input and option browsing.* |   |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Preserve focus and context

Ensure seamless transitions and focus management to maintain user orientation, particularly in overlays and nested flows.

>Principle: **🌍 Accessible**

|   | ![](/Penny-documentation/foundation/assets/mobile-patterns-image-4.png)*Focus is directed to the relevant content, even when a side sheet is opened.* |   |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Optimize for touch

Increase target sizes, respect thumb reach zones, and ensure predictable interactions across all components.

>Principle: **⚖️ Consistent**

## Design for growth

Create mobile patterns that work across brands, screen sizes, and use cases, supporting partner theming and future expansion.

>Principle: **🤸 Flexible**

|   | ![](/Penny-documentation/foundation/assets/mobile-patterns-image-6.png)*The Delete bill dialog appears as a bottom sheet rather than a modal.* |   |
