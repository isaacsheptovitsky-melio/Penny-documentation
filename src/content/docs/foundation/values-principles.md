Allows Melio to grow its product offerings while maintaining consistency. This is crucial as we will be working with many partners, and our design and UX must be able to support diverse needs and requirements.

### What does it mean?

We design components and experiences in a way that will serve a growing number of users, other than melio.com users.

## **⚙️ Efficiency**

Pre-built components reduce development time and improve focus on solving business problems. Our design team is encouraged to solve design problems efficiently, communicate with each other in order to avoid duplicating work, and leverage Penny's components and layouts to achieve this goal

### **What does it mean?**

- We are aligned on how we design experiences
- We reuse existing [layouts](https://zeroheight.com/98bb1df01/p/63ec5f) and components to maximize efficiency, minimize duplication, and allocate more time for innovation and solving complex problems.

## **⛑️ Quality**

Standardized components ensure a high level of quality across products. Quality is about more than just appearance—it encompasses functionality, reliability, and user experience.

### **What does it mean?**

- We test our components to ensure consistent performance across various devices, browsers, and scenarios
- We incorporates user feedback to refine components and experiences continuously
