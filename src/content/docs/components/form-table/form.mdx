## Usage

- **Group related information:** Use a form to collect a set of related data from a user, such as adding a new vendor's contact and payment details.
- **Structure complex tasks:** Break down complex processes like scheduling a payment into logical steps contained within a form.

## Variants

### Global states

The Form propagates these states to all nested form fields:

- **Default:** Standard interactive state for data entry.
- **Disabled (`isDisabled`):** Greys out all fields and prevents interaction. Use this when a user does not have permission to edit payment settings.
- **Read-Only (`isReadOnly`):** Allows users to select and copy text but prevents editing. Useful for reviewing past transactions.
- **View Mode (`isViewMode`):** Renders the values as plain text rather than input boxes, ideal for summary screens.
- **Loading (`isLoading`):** Indicates that form data is being refreshed or fetched.
- **Error State (`errorState`):** Forces an error state on all fields, typically used when a backend validation fails for the entire group.

## Layout

**Columns** define how child elements are arranged (e.g., 1 column for a simple stack, 2+ columns for wider screens).
