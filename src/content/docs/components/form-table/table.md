## Patterns of use

We have different patterns of use for the table, where we use different features in order to achieve the best UX for our users.

### Pinned columns

Pinned columns stay fixed to one side of the table when it scrolls horizontally, ensuring they remain visible to the user.

#### Guidelines:

* Pin only 1–2 columns when possible
* Avoid pinning columns on both sides of the table.

>🤓 **Tip**: Pin columns that provide key context to help users interpret the data in other cells.

### Expandable rows

Expandable rows let you group related information under a single row, allowing users to reveal additional details without cluttering the main UI.
