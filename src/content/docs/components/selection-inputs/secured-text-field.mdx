## Desktop usage and treatment

Secured text fields on desktop should provide clear visual feedback for the show/hide toggle and maintain security while allowing users to verify their input when needed. The toggle button should be easily accessible and provide clear visual states.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, secured text fields should accommodate touch interactions for the visibility toggle and ensure the masked text remains secure. Consider the mobile keyboard context and provide appropriate input types for different secure field purposes.
