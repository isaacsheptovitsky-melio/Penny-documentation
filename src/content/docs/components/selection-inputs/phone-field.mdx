## Usage

* Use the Phone Field when collecting phone numbers from users.
* The number is masked to a phone format

> **Note**: The phone field only formats the number to appear as a phone number, it doesn't recognize country code or assign country flag.

> **Note:** For details on sizes, behaviors, and general guidelines applicable to all form components, refer to the [Form Field](https://zeroheight.com/98bb1df01/p/6854b6-form-field) documentation.

## Desktop usage and treatment

Phone fields on desktop should provide clear formatting as users type and support standard input interactions. The masking should be intuitive and not interfere with user input flow.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, phone fields should automatically trigger the numeric keypad and accommodate various international phone number formats. The formatting should adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining readability.
