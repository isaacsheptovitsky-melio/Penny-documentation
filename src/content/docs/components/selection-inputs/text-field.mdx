## Usage

* Text fields are normally found within a form but can also be part of a modal, search, or card.
* Make sure your text field has a short, descriptive label above it that describes what the user should type into the box below.
* Use `label` elements or `aria-label` for screen readers.

> **Note:** For details on sizes, behaviors, and general guidelines applicable to all form components, refer to the [Form Field](https://zeroheight.com/98bb1df01/p/6854b6-form-field) documentation.

## Desktop usage and treatment

Text fields on desktop should provide clear visual feedback for focus and validation states. Labels should be properly positioned and helper text should be easily readable. The input should support standard keyboard interactions and shortcuts.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, text fields should trigger appropriate keyboards for different input types (email, numeric, etc.) and have adequate touch targets. The interface should adapt to the virtual keyboard and provide clear visual feedback for validation states.
