## Usage

* When clicked, the Date picker triggers displays the Calendar component
* Upon date selection, the Calendar component is hidden, and the chosen date is set in the input field

> **Note**: The Date Picker component is optional. The Date Field component already serves as an effective trigger for date selection, making the Date Picker unnecessary in most cases.

## Desktop usage and treatment

Date pickers on desktop should provide clear visual feedback for interaction states and ensure the calendar popup is properly positioned relative to the trigger element.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, date pickers should accommodate touch interactions and may benefit from larger touch targets. Consider using native mobile date pickers when appropriate for better user experience.
