## Desktop usage and treatment

Amount fields should maintain consistent alignment patterns across desktop interfaces. When used in tables or forms, right-alignment is typically preferred for better visual scanning of monetary values.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, amount fields should adapt to smaller screen sizes while maintaining usability. Consider the touch target size and ensure the End Element (if present) remains easily accessible.
