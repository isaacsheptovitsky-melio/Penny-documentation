### ❌ Don't
**Don't pre-fill dates unless necessary**
Don't assume a default date unless necessary: Pre-filling a date can lead to accidental selections.

## Desktop usage and treatment

Date fields on desktop should provide clear visual indicators for the calendar trigger and support both click and keyboard interactions. The calendar popup should be properly positioned relative to the input field.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, date fields should accommodate touch interactions and potentially trigger native date pickers when appropriate. The calendar component should adapt to smaller screen sizes while maintaining usability.
