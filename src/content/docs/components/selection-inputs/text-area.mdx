## Usage

* Unlike a standard text field, which is intended for single-line input, the text area is optimized for handling large amounts of text with improved usability and visibility.
* Use a text area when users need to enter multiple lines of text, such as: comments and feedback forms, descriptions and notes, messages or email drafts

> **Note:** For details on sizes, behaviors, and general guidelines applicable to all form components, refer to the [Form Field](https://zeroheight.com/98bb1df01/p/6854b6-form-field) documentation.

## Variants

### Size

The input has a default height of 4 rows, which is the equivalent of 128px. The default height could be set by overriding the default `numberOfRows` to a different value.

### Max chars

* **Character Limit**: Use the `maxChars` prop to define the maximum number of characters allowed (e.g., `maxChars={10}`).
* **Visual Counter**: To display the character count, wrap the `TextArea` component in a `FormField`.

## Desktop usage and treatment

Text areas on desktop should provide adequate space for content entry and clear visual feedback for focus states. The resize functionality should be intuitive and the character counter (when present) should be easily visible.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, text areas should adapt to smaller screens while maintaining usability for longer text entry. The virtual keyboard should provide appropriate input types and the interface should accommodate the reduced viewport when the keyboard is active.
