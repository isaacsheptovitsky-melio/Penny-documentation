## Desktop usage and treatment

File attachments on desktop should provide clear visual feedback for drag-and-drop operations and support standard file browser interactions. Error states should be clearly communicated with actionable recovery options.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, file attachments should accommodate touch interactions and consider the limitations of mobile file systems. The upload process should be optimized for mobile networks and provide clear progress indicators.
