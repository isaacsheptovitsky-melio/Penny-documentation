## Usage

* Click any enabled date to select the primary date.
* The secondary date, shown with a simple gray outline, provides additional context, such as the vendor's payment receival date.
* Click the header to open the year list and select a different year.
* By default, the Calendar component includes an optional footer with a slot that can be replaced with a custom footer

## Variants

### Min-max date

The min and max variants limit users to selecting a date within a specified range, preventing choices that are too early or too late.

## Use cases

*When creating a new Bill, the Calendar component is used to set up the Invoice date and the Due date*

## Desktop usage and treatment

The Calendar component on desktop provides hover states for better interactivity and clear visual feedback. Month and year navigation should be easily accessible, and the legend (when present) should be positioned to not interfere with date selection.

## Mobile usage and treatment

The component opens in the same manner as desktop on mobile devices, but with touch-optimized interactions.
