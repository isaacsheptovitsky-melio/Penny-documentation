## Components Overview

Components are reusable UI elements that encapsulate both design and functionality. They serve as the building blocks for creating consistent, accessible, and scalable user interfaces across the Penny ecosystem.

## Component Categories

### Form Components
Interactive elements that handle user input and data collection.
- **Buttons** - Primary, secondary, and tertiary action triggers
- **Input Fields** - Text, email, password, and specialized input types
- **Select Menus** - Dropdown selections and multi-select options
- **Checkboxes & Radio Buttons** - Binary and single-choice selections
- **Form Layout** - Field groups, sections, and form containers

### Navigation Components
Elements that help users move through and understand the application structure.
- **Navigation Bars** - Primary and secondary navigation systems
- **Breadcrumbs** - Hierarchical navigation indicators
- **Tabs** - Content organization and switching
- **Pagination** - Data set navigation
- **Links** - Text and icon-based navigation elements

### Feedback Components
Components that communicate system status, user actions, and important information.
- **Alerts & Notifications** - Success, error, warning, and info messages
- **Toasts** - Temporary feedback messages
- **Status Indicators** - Progress bars, loading states, and status badges
- **Tooltips** - Contextual help and information
- **Modals & Dialogs** - Important communications and confirmations

### Display Components
Components for presenting information and organizing content.
- **Cards** - Content containers and information display
- **Tables** - Structured data presentation
- **Lists** - Organized content display
- **Badges & Tags** - Status and category indicators
- **Avatars** - User and entity representation
- **Typography** - Text styles and hierarchy

### Layout Components
Structural elements that organize and position content.
- **Grid System** - Responsive layout structure
- **Containers** - Content width and spacing control
- **Sections** - Content area organization
- **Dividers** - Visual content separation
- **Spacers** - Layout spacing and rhythm

## Component Design Principles

### Consistency
All components follow the same design patterns, interaction behaviors, and visual styling to create a predictable user experience.

### Accessibility
Components are built with accessibility as a foundation, including proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

### Flexibility
Components support theming, sizing variants, and customization options while maintaining design system integrity.

### Performance
Components are optimized for performance with efficient rendering and minimal resource usage.

## Using Components

### Implementation Guidelines
- Use components as documented without modification
- Follow the specified props and configuration options
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment patterns
- Test components across different screen sizes and devices

### Best Practices
- Choose the appropriate component variant for each use case
- Combine components thoughtfully to create cohesive interfaces
- Follow accessibility guidelines when implementing components
- Validate that component usage aligns with design system principles

### Documentation Structure
Each component section includes:
- **Overview** - Purpose and usage guidelines
- **Variants** - Available styles and configurations
- **Props** - Technical implementation details
- **Examples** - Visual and code examples
- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance and best practices
- **Do's and Don'ts** - Usage guidelines and common mistakes

## Quality Assurance

### Testing
All components undergo rigorous testing for:
- Visual consistency across browsers and devices
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Interaction behavior and state management
- Performance and rendering optimization

### Feedback and Iteration
Components are continuously improved based on:
- User feedback and usability testing
- Development team input and technical requirements
- Accessibility audits and compliance reviews
- Performance monitoring and optimization opportunities
