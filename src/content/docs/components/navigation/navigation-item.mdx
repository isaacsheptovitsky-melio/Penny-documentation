## Usage

* Ensure the label of each Navigation item concisely communicates its destination
* Arrange Navigation items logically, prioritizing frequently accessed sections or actions
* Can include icons to indicate the destination

<Aside type="tip">
  Use icon-only variants sparingly and only when the icon meaning is universally clear or paired with a tooltip.
</Aside>

## Variants

### Selected

Represents the active state, visually indicating the user's current location or selected navigation option.

### Custom content

Allows for embedding custom structures, such as combining icons and text (arranged vertically, horizontally, or icon-only), to create richer content within the navigation item.

### Full width

A layout option where the navigation item expands to occupy the entire width of its parent container.

### As link

Specifies that the item should render as a semantic HTML link (`<a>` tag), used for navigating to different URLs or page sections.

## Desktop usage and treatment

On desktop, navigation items should have clear hover states and maintain consistent spacing. Consider using horizontal layouts for primary navigation and ensure adequate spacing between items.

## Mobile usage and treatment

* Navigation often collapses into "hamburger" menus
* Frequently used items might appear in a bottom navigation bar
* Prioritize visibility of critical items

## Accessibility

* **Use icons meaningfully:** When incorporating icons, ensure they are paired with clear text labels or, if used alone, that their meaning is understood and an accessible name is provided for screen reader users
* **Write descriptive labels:** Design with clear, concise labels that accurately describe the destination or action. This helps users understand the purpose of each item without needing extra context.
* **Specify role (link vs. button):** Clearly indicate in your design specifications whether an item is intended to navigate (link) or perform an action (button), as this impacts how developers will implement it for accessibility.
