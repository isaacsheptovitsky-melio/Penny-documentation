## Usage

* Use pagination at the **bottom of a table or list** when the total number of items exceeds the page size (e.g., 25, 50, or 100)
* Display page numbers when there are multiple pages to help users understand their current location
* Include next/previous buttons for sequential navigation
* Consider showing total number of items and current range for context

## Desktop usage and treatment

On desktop, pagination should display multiple page numbers with clear navigation controls. Use adequate spacing and hover states to improve usability.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile, consider simplified pagination with just previous/next buttons or showing fewer page numbers to conserve space. Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized.
