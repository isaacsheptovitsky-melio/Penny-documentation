## Usage

Use a link when you want to:

* Navigate to a different page within the Melio app (e.g., from the dashboard to the "Payables" page)
* Direct users to an external URL, such as a help article or a partner website

<Aside type="tip">
  To prevent user confusion, always make sure link text clearly describes its destination. For example, use "View invoice details" instead of a generic "Click here."
</Aside>

## Variants

### Type

Links come in two main types:

* **Standalone**: Used for navigation that stands on its own, such as in a navigation menu or as a primary call to action. It has more styling options like size and boldness.
* **Inline**: Used within a sentence or a block of text to link specific words without disrupting the flow of the content. For example: "Please review the `Terms of Service` before proceeding."

### Color

You can apply different colors to a link to fit its context:

* **Default**: The standard link color for most use cases
* **Secondary**: The brand color for more prominent links
* **Inverse**: For use on dark backgrounds to ensure high contrast
* **Inherit**: The link will inherit the color of its parent text element

### Size

Standalone links can be set to two sizes:

* **Medium**: The default size for most standalone links (Using `Body3` style)
* **Large**: Used for more prominent navigational links that need to draw more attention (Using `Body2` style)

### Bold

Make a standalone link bold to give it more visual weight.

### Disabled

A disabled link is not clickable and appears grayed out.

### Ellipsis

Use the ellipsis style when the link text might be too long for its container. It will truncate the text and add "..." to the end.

<Aside type="caution">
  Truncated links can pose an accessibility challenge. Prioritize clear and concise link labels that fit the available space whenever possible.
</Aside>

## Desktop usage and treatment

On desktop, links should have clear hover states and sufficient spacing for easy interaction. Ensure proper color contrast and readable font sizes.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile, ensure links have adequate touch targets (minimum 44px) and maintain readability across different screen sizes. Consider the context of surrounding content when designing mobile link layouts.

## Accessibility

**Descriptive labels**: Ensure the link's text accurately describes its purpose. For screen reader users, avoid vague text like "Learn More."

**Truncated Links**: If a link label must be truncated, ensure a tooltip displays the full text on hover and focus. Most importantly, the link's accessible name must be the full, untruncated text so a screen reader announces its complete purpose. Use the `title` attribute or a custom tooltip for this.
