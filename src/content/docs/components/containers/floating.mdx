## Usage

* Use when additional context or actions need to appear relative to a specific UI element
* Leverages dynamic placement to ensure content remains visible within the viewport, adjusting automatically if screen space is limited.

## Trigger

While buttons are the standard trigger, the component supports any element as its trigger.

  Ensure a minimum of 24*24px target for the custom trigger

## Desktop usage and treatment

On desktop, floating components should position intelligently based on available viewport space and provide clear visual connection to their trigger element.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, screen real estate is limited. While the Floating component attempts to adjust placement, consider if a **Bottom Sheet** or full-screen adaptation is a better experience for complex forms (like linking a bank account) on small screens.
