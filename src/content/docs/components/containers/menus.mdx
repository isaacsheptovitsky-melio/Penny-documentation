## Usage

Menus provide organized lists of actions or options that users can select from. They come in different variants to accommodate various interface needs and viewport sizes.

## Flat menu
A `Flat Menu` opens inline, directly below its trigger. Unlike a `Floating Menu`, it integrates into the page layout and pushes surrounding content down instead of floating above it.

### Usage
Use the `Flat Menu` in specific scenarios where a floating panel is undesirable, such as the Combobox (in mobile view).

## Floating menu
A `Floating Menu` is an overlay panel that appears next to a trigger element, detached from the page's normal flow. It's the standard menu experience for desktop and other large-viewport layouts.

### Usage
The `Floating Menu` is the default desktop behavior for our standard `Menu` patterns.

* **Default Desktop Menu:** When you use the `Menu`, `Actions Menu`, or `Selectable Menu` patterns, they will automatically render as a `Floating Menu` on desktop viewports.
* **Custom Popovers:** Use this component directly to build a custom desktop-specific control that requires complex internal structure, such as sections, dividers, or embedded elements like a search bar.

### Anatomy

#### Header

An optional. dedicated slot at the top of the menu. Ideal for a title, a search bar, or a back button for nested navigation.

#### Footer

### **Sizing**

* **Width:** Can be set to a default fixed width (`240px`), a custom pixel value, or `'match-trigger'` to equal the width of its trigger element.
* **Max Width:** Constrains the width when it's determined by the content, preventing it from becoming too wide.
* **Max Height:** Sets the maximum vertical height (default `256px`) before the content list becomes scrollable.

### Patterns

These are ready-to-use components, based on the `Floating Menu` .

#### Menu

A simple menu of predefined options.

#### Actions Menu

Use the **Actions Dropdown Menu** for a fast, consistent, and conventional way to add a list of actions.

#### Selectable Dropdown Menu

The Selectable Dropdown Menu is ideal for choices where the trigger button dynamically updates to reflect the currently selected value.

#### Sort Dropdown Menu

Use the Sort Dropdown Menu for sorting a list or a table.

### Do's and Don'ts

#### ✅ Do
**Use a reasonable maxHeight for compact navigation**
Use a reasonable maxHeight to ensure the menu remains compact and easy to navigate.

#### ❌ Don't
**Don't create excessively tall menus**
Create menus that are excessively tall.

#### ✅ Do
**Use Sections and Dividers to organize menus**
Use Sections and Dividers to organize long or complex menus into logical groups.

#### ❌ Don't
**Don't embed complex forms in Floating Menus**
Embed complex forms or multi-step flows within a Floating Menu.

## Bottom sheet menu
A `Bottom Sheet Menu` is a modal overlay that slides up from the bottom of the screen. It is the standard menu experience on mobile devices, providing a large, touch-friendly surface for interaction.

### Usage
The `Bottom Sheet Menu` is the default mobile behavior for our standard `Menu` patterns. In most cases, you will not need to use this component directly.

* **Default Mobile Menu:** When you use the `Menu`, `Actions Menu`, or `Selectable Menu` patterns, they will automatically render as a `Bottom Sheet Menu` on mobile viewports.
* **Custom Mobile Flows:** Use this component directly when designing a unique, mobile-first experience that is not covered by our predefined patterns.

### Anatomy

**Bottom sheet anatomy**

1. **Overlay:** A semi-transparent layer that covers the page content, indicating that the menu is active and the background is inert.
2. **Sheet Container:** The main panel that slides up from the bottom, containing all the menu content.
3. **Title (Optional):** A text label at the top of the sheet that clearly explains the purpose of the menu (e.g., "Sort by").
4. **Close Button:** An explicit icon button to dismiss the menu. Users can also typically dismiss it by tapping the overlay.
5. **Content:** The main body of the sheet where the list of items is displayed. If the content exceeds the available height, this area becomes vertically scrollable.
6. **Footer (Optional):** A persistent section at the bottom of the sheet, typically used for primary actions like "Apply" or "Done."

## Desktop usage and treatment

In mobile view, the items within the `Floating Menu` are displayed in a `Bottom Sheet`.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On desktop, menus appear as floating overlays positioned near their trigger elements. They should maintain appropriate sizing and positioning to ensure they remain within viewport boundaries.
