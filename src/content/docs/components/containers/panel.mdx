* Set position to `sticky` (default) for panels that remain visible within scrollable containers
* Use `fixed` or `absolute` for overlays
* Adjust background color to match your use case

### Transition

The Panel is using the [Slide](https://penny.melio.com/?path=/docs/foundations-transitions-slide--docs) transition by default; toggle panel to view transition.

## Use cases

The panel appears when one or more rows in a table are selected, allowing batch actions.

## Desktop usage and treatment

On desktop, panels provide sticky or fixed positioning for contextual actions and navigation. They should maintain appropriate sizing and positioning relative to their container or viewport.

## Mobile usage and treatment

The panel isn't shown on mobile devices, as it's challenging to display effectively on smaller screens.
