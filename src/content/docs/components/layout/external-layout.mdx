- Use for pages accessed by external users such as vendors or guest payers
- Utilize the `logo` prop to replace default Melio branding with partner logos for white-labeled experiences
- Use the `isLoading` state to prevent user interaction during critical updates

<Aside type="tip">
  When creating white-labeled experiences for partners, utilize the `logo` prop to replace the default Melio branding with the partner's logo.

## Anatomy

* **Header:** The area positioned at the top right. Use this for auxiliary actions like "Login" or "Help."
* **Logo:** By default, this displays the Melio logo. It can be overridden with a custom `ReactElement` for specific branding requirements.
* **Content:** The primary workspace of the screen. This is where the form inputs, payment details, or confirmation messages reside.
* **Footer:** The bottom section, typically used for legal disclaimers, copyright info, or secondary links.

## Props

### Loading state

A boolean state (`isLoading`) that overlays the layout to indicate background processing, preventing user interaction during critical updates.

### Hide logo

Removes the logo in the header.

### Override logo

Allows overriding the logo displayed.

## Desktop usage and treatment

The layout provides a clean, focused interface for external users accessing payment forms or vendor portals. The header remains minimal to reduce distractions while ensuring essential navigation elements are accessible.

## Mobile usage and treatment

The layout is fully responsive. On mobile devices, the internal padding adjusts to maximize screen real estate. Ensure that the `content` and `footer` elements stack vertically and remain legible on smaller touchscreens.
