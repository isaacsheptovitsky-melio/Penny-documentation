### Common use

The most common use of the Split layout is pairing a job with an asset, such as sharing an invoice, where the invoice appears on the left and actions on the right.

## Desktop usage and treatment

On desktop displays, the split layout maintains its horizontal arrangement, allowing users to view and interact with both panels simultaneously. This is particularly effective for workflows that require comparing information or maintaining context while performing actions.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, the split layout is rearranged to a vertical layout:
