## Button

The Button component is used to trigger actions or events, such as form submissions and navigation.

:::tip[Interactive Component Testing]
The embedded Storybook examples below allow you to test the Button component with different props and states in real-time. This helps you understand how the component behaves before implementing it in your application.

## Interactive Example

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Live Component" icon="play">

Try out the different button variants and states in the live component below:

  allow="clipboard-write"
  style="border: 1px solid #e1e5e9; border-radius: 8px; margin: 16px 0;"

**Controls:** Use the Controls panel below the component to experiment with different props, sizes, and states.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Code Examples" icon="code">

```jsx
// Primary Button
<Button variant="primary" size="medium">
  Save Changes
</Button>

// Secondary Button with Icon
<Button variant="secondary" size="medium" leftIcon="filter">
  Filter Results
</Button>

// Critical Button for Destructive Actions

## Usage

- Use for proper actions, such as submitting forms or initiating key flows
- Secondary and tertiary variants should support less prominent actions
- Use the Disabled variant to prevent interactions when an action is unavailable
  - However, don't use a disabled button to indicate that form submission would be invalid

## Variants

### Hierarchy

The Button component has several levels of hierarchy:

![Primary](/Penny-documentation/components/button/button-primary.png)

**Primary**

---

![Secondary](/Penny-documentation/components/button/button-secondary.png)

**Secondary**

---

![Tertiary](/Penny-documentation/components/button/button-tertiary.png)

**Tertiary**

---

![Critical](/Penny-documentation/components/button/button-critical.png)

**Critical**

---

### States

All buttons share the same set of states:

- **Rest**: the default appearance
- **Hover**: When the user points at the button with the cursor
- **Pressed**: The moment the button is clicked or tapped
- **Loading**: While the system processes the action
- **Disabled**: When the action is unavailable

### Inverse

![Secondary - Inverse](/Penny-documentation/components/button/button-secondary-inverse.png)

### Disabled state

All button types share the same disabled state.

**Disabled state**

> 🤓 **Tip**: If you're wondering whether the disabled state meets WCAG contrast requirements—no fear, accessibility-loving friend! Disabled elements don't have to follow contrast ratio rules.

### Sizes

Buttons are available in 3 sizes, with the Medium size being the default variant.

## Left and right elements

The button includes two slots, left and right elements, typically used for icons that either clarify the button's purpose or suggest UI behavior.

![Left element](/Penny-documentation/components/button/button-left-element.png)

**Left element**

---

![Right element](/Penny-documentation/components/button/button-right-element.png)

**Right element**

---

### Using both right and left elements

It's not recommended using both right and left elements too often, since it may clutter the UI and become repetitive, defeating the differentiating effect of the icon.

### ✅ Do

**Use the left element for global functions**
Use the left element for global functions, i.e. a single filter button on screen.
![](/Penny-documentation/components/button/button-left-element-do.png)

### ❌ Don't

**Avoid repeating left icons for similar actions**
Avoid using the same left icon for similar actions with slight variations, as repeating the icon reduces its impact and clarity.

### Additional use cases

## Critical button UX pattern

Destructive actions, like deleting content, follow a confirmatory flow to prevent accidental clicks. The initial trigger is typically a tertiary button labeled clearly (e.g., "Delete vendor"). This opens a modal asking the user to confirm the action.

_When deleting a bill, the user is first presented with a critical-text "Delete bill", that signals a destructive action. Clicking this button opens a confirmation modal._

### Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ Do

**Expose up to 3 buttons**

### ❌ Don't

**Don't place secondary buttons to the right of prominent buttons**

## Mobile usage and treatment

### Width
