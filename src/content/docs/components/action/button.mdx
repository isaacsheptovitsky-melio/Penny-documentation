## Button

The Button component is used to trigger actions or events, such as form submissions and navigation.

:::tip[Interactive Component Testing]
The embedded Storybook examples below allow you to test the Button component with different props and states in real-time. This helps you understand how the component behaves before implementing it in your application.

## Interactive Example

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Live Component" icon="play">

Try out the different button variants and states in the live component below:

  width="100%"
  height="500px"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="clipboard-write"
  style="border: 1px solid #e1e5e9; border-radius: 8px; margin: 16px 0;"

**Controls:** Use the Controls panel below the component to experiment with different props, sizes, and states.

<TabItem label="Code Examples" icon="code">

```jsx
// Primary Button
<Button variant="primary" size="medium">
  Save Changes
</Button>

// Secondary Button with Icon
<Button variant="secondary" size="medium" leftIcon="filter">
  Filter Results
</Button>

// Critical Button for Destructive Actions
<Button variant="critical" size="medium">
  Delete Account
</Button>

// Disabled Button
<Button variant="primary" size="medium" disabled>
  Processing...
</Button>
```

## Usage

- Use for proper actions, such as submitting forms or initiating key flows
- Secondary and tertiary variants should support less prominent actions
- Use the Disabled variant to prevent interactions when an action is unavailable
  - However, don't use a disabled button to indicate that form submission would be invalid

## Variants

### Hierarchy

The Button component has several levels of hierarchy:

![Primary](/Penny-documentation/components/button/button-primary.png)

**Primary**

**Secondary** - Secondary button variant for less prominent actions

**Tertiary** - Tertiary button variant for supporting actions  

**Critical** - Critical button variant for destructive actions

---

### States

All buttons share the same set of states:

- **Rest**: the default appearance
- **Hover**: When the user points at the button with the cursor
- **Pressed**: The moment the button is clicked or tapped
- **Loading**: While the system processes the action
- **Disabled**: When the action is unavailable

All button variants (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Critical) follow these consistent states for interaction feedback.

---

### Inverse

Use the inverse variants on top of dark backgrounds:

- **Primary Inverse** - Light colored primary button for dark backgrounds
- **Secondary Inverse** - Light colored secondary button for dark backgrounds

---

### Disabled state

All button types share the same disabled state with reduced opacity and no interaction capabilities.

> 🤓 **Tip**: If you're wondering whether the disabled state meets WCAG contrast requirements—no fear, accessibility-loving friend! Disabled elements don't have to follow contrast ratio rules.

### Sizes

Buttons are available in 3 sizes, with the Medium size being the default variant:

- **Small** - Compact size for tight layouts
- **Medium** - Default size (recommended)  
- **Large** - Prominent size for primary actions

---

## Left and right elements

The button includes two slots, left and right elements, typically used for icons that either clarify the button's purpose or suggest UI behavior:

- **Left element** - Icon positioned before button text (e.g., filter icons, action indicators)
- **Right element** - Icon positioned after button text (e.g., dropdown arrows, external link indicators)

---

### Using both right and left elements

It's not recommended using both right and left elements too often, since it may clutter the UI and become repetitive, defeating the differentiating effect of the icon.

### ✅ Do

**Use the left element for global functions**
Use the left element for global functions, i.e. a single filter button on screen.

### ❌ Don't

**Avoid repeating left icons for similar actions**
Avoid using the same left icon for similar actions with slight variations, as repeating the icon reduces its impact and clarity.

### Additional use cases

Buttons can include custom elements like badges, counters, or status indicators alongside icons for enhanced functionality.

## Critical button UX pattern

Destructive actions, like deleting content, follow a confirmatory flow to prevent accidental clicks. The initial trigger is typically a tertiary button labeled clearly (e.g., "Delete vendor"). This opens a modal asking the user to confirm the action.

_When deleting a bill, the user is first presented with a critical-text "Delete bill", that signals a destructive action. Clicking this button opens a confirmation modal._

## Desktop usage and treatment

### Width

**Hug content** - Buttons should size themselves to their content by default

### ✅ Do

**Use hug contents to set the button's width**
Use hug contents to set the button's width for optimal spacing and readability.

### ❌ Don't

**Don't use fill container unless on mobile**
Avoid using fill container width on desktop; reserve this for mobile layouts.

### Placement

Place primary (essential) actions on the right and secondary or optional actions on the left.

### ✅ Do

**Place buttons horizontally, next to each other**
Place buttons horizontally, next to each other for better user experience and scanning.

### ❌ Don't

**Don't place buttons vertically, one on top of the other**
Avoid vertical button stacking on desktop as it creates unnecessary visual noise.

### Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ Do

**Expose up to 3 buttons**
Limit to maximum 3 buttons per screen section to avoid overwhelming users.

### ❌ Don't

**Don't expose more than 3 buttons for a part of the screen**
Avoid more than 3 buttons in a single area as it creates decision paralysis.

---

### ✅ Do

**Place the essential action on the far-right of the layout**
Position the primary action on the far-right following natural reading patterns.

### ❌ Don't

**Don't place secondary buttons to the right of prominent buttons**
Avoid placing secondary or tertiary buttons to the right of more prominent buttons.

> ✅ These guidelines support consistent action arrangement. However, if an optional action needs extra emphasis due to its business impact, it's okay to break the rule.

---

## Mobile usage and treatment

### Width

**Fill container on mobile** - Buttons should expand to full container width on mobile devices for better touch targets.

### Placement

When placing buttons side by side, let buttons hug content and their width be determined by the content of the button. On mobile, prefer vertical stacking for better accessibility.

**Vertical placement** - Stack buttons vertically on mobile for easier interaction and better usability.
