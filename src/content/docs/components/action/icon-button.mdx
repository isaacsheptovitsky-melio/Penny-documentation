## Usage

- Use for actions that can be easily understood through an icon alone
- Always pair with a tooltip or aria-label to convey meaning
- Avoid using for primary actions (e.g., form submissions)

<Aside type="tip">
  Use icon buttons to declutter interfaces, especially in dense areas like
  tables or cards.

## Variants

### Types

The Icon button component has several levels of hierarchy:

![Primary](/Penny-documentation/components/icon-button/icon-button-image-1.png)
**Primary**

For clear but non-essential emphasis.

&nbsp;

![Naked](/Penny-documentation/components/icon-button/icon-button-image-2.png)
**Naked**

Minimal styling, typically used in place of the Primary variant when a more subdued visual presence is needed.

&nbsp;

![Brand](/Penny-documentation/components/icon-button/icon-button-image-3.png)
**Brand**

Use with caution — this variant is only used on mobile as the omni-action button.

### States

All icon buttons share the same set of states:

- **Rest**: the default appearance
- **Hover**: When the user points at the button with the cursor
- **Pressed**: The moment the button is clicked or tapped
- **Disabled**: When the action is unavailable

## Desktop usage and treatment

### Placement

Place icon buttons in appropriate contexts where space is limited and the action is secondary to the main content.

### Accessibility

Always ensure icon buttons have proper tooltips or aria-labels to communicate their purpose to screen readers.

## Mobile usage and treatment

### Touch targets

Maintain adequate touch target sizes (minimum 44px) for mobile interactions, especially for small icon buttons.

### Tooltips

Consider alternative approaches to tooltips on mobile devices, as they may not be as discoverable.
