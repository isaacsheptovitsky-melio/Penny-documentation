## Props

### Auto Play

The video begins playing immediately upon loading. When enabled, the video is automatically muted to prevent disrupting the user experience.

### Muted

Silences the audio by default. This is useful for background loops or UI demonstrations that don't require sound.

### Loop

Automatically restarts the video once it reaches the end—ideal for short, repetitive demonstrations of specific UI actions.

### Controls visibility

Show or hide the default browser playback controls (Play/Pause, volume, progress bar).

### Custom size

Dimensions can be defined in absolute pixels (e.g., 640px) or relative percentages (e.g., 100%) to fit various layout containers.
