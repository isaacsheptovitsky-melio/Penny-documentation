## Usage

- Use for educational content and product demonstrations
- Implement for onboarding flows and tutorial sequences
- Apply for marketing content and promotional materials
- Utilize for background visuals in hero sections

## Props

### Auto Play

The video begins playing immediately upon loading. When enabled, the video is automatically muted to prevent disrupting the user experience.

### Muted

Silences the audio by default. This is useful for background loops or UI demonstrations that don't require sound.

### Loop

Automatically restarts the video once it reaches the end—ideal for short, repetitive demonstrations of specific UI actions.

### Controls visibility

Show or hide the default browser playback controls (Play/Pause, volume, progress bar).

### Custom size

Dimensions can be defined in absolute pixels (e.g., 640px) or relative percentages (e.g., 100%) to fit various layout containers.

## Desktop usage and treatment

- Use appropriate video controls for user interaction preferences
- Consider bandwidth and loading performance for larger video files
- Implement proper aspect ratios to maintain visual consistency
- Ensure accessible controls and keyboard navigation support
- Use autoplay sparingly and only when it enhances the user experience

## Mobile usage and treatment

- Optimize video compression for mobile bandwidth constraints
- Consider data usage impact and provide quality options when possible
- Ensure touch-friendly controls and proper sizing for small screens
- Test autoplay behavior across different mobile browsers and platforms
- Implement proper responsive sizing for various screen orientations
