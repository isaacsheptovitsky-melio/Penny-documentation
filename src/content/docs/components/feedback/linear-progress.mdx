## Usage

The Linear Progress component provides visual feedback about the status of ongoing processes in a horizontal bar format. It's ideal for displaying progress in forms, file uploads, or other sequential processes where users need clear indication of completion status.

## Desktop usage and treatment

The Linear Progress component spans the full width of its container on desktop, providing clear visual feedback for ongoing processes with sufficient space for detailed progress indication.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, the Linear Progress component maintains its linear format while adapting to smaller screen widths, ensuring progress feedback remains clear and accessible.
