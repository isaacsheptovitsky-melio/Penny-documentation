## Usage

Skeleton components provide visual placeholders that help users understand that content is loading while maintaining the perceived layout structure. They improve the user experience by reducing perceived loading time and providing clear indication of where content will appear.

## Skeleton

The standard rectangular block used for single lines of data or UI elements.

* **Props:** `height` (Default: `'20px'`).
* **Use case**: Simulating input fields, table rows, etc.

## Skeleton Circle

A circular variant specifically designed for round elements.

* **Props:** `diameter` (Default: `'20px'`).
* **Use case:** Simulating vendor logos, bank institution icons, or user profile avatars.

## Skeleton Text

A multi-line variant used to simulate blocks of text.

* **Props:**
    * `numberOfLines`: Controls how many "rows" of text are simulated (Default: `2`).
    * `spacing`: Controls the vertical gap between lines (Options: `none` to `xxxl`, Default: `'xs'`).
* **Use case:** Simulating multi-line content such as invoice notes, payment terms, or address blocks.

## Desktop usage and treatment

Skeleton components on desktop maintain consistent spacing and proportions that match the actual content they're representing. They should accurately reflect the final layout to avoid layout shift when real content loads.

## Mobile usage and treatment

On mobile devices, skeleton components scale appropriately to fit smaller screens while maintaining their placeholder function. They adapt to mobile layout patterns and touch-friendly sizing requirements.
