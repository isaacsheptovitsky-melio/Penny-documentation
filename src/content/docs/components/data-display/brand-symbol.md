## Usage

* Use when space is tight but brand recognition is still important
* Use only approved logo assets at the correct size
* Choose variants that maintain visibility on different backgrounds
* Pair with a label only when necessary. Icons should be recognizable on their own

>🤓 **Tip**: Use brand symbols when a full logo isn't needed but clarity and consistency still matter (e.g., sync screens, dropdowns, tiles).
