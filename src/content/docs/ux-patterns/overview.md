# UX Patterns Overview

UX Patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems that help create consistent and intuitive user experiences across Melio Payments' products. These patterns provide guidance on how users interact with our interfaces and help ensure predictable behavior.

## What are UX Patterns?

UX Patterns are standardized approaches to solving recurring design challenges. They encompass:

- **Interaction behaviors** - How users navigate and interact with elements
- **Information architecture** - How content is organized and presented
- **User flows** - Step-by-step processes users follow to complete tasks
- **Feedback mechanisms** - How the system communicates with users

## Pattern Categories

### Navigation Patterns
Guidelines for helping users move through our applications efficiently and intuitively.

### Form Patterns
Best practices for data input, validation, and form completion workflows.

### Data Display
Patterns for presenting information in clear, scannable, and actionable formats.

### Feedback Patterns
How we communicate system status, success states, and user actions to build trust and clarity.

### Loading States
Managing user expectations during processing and data retrieval.

### Empty States
Guiding users when there's no content to display and encouraging positive actions.

### Error Handling
Helping users understand and recover from errors gracefully.

## Using UX Patterns

Each pattern includes:
- **When to use** - Specific scenarios where the pattern applies
- **Behavior specifications** - Detailed interaction requirements
- **Visual examples** - Mockups and prototypes demonstrating the pattern
- **Implementation notes** - Technical considerations for developers
- **Accessibility requirements** - Ensuring inclusive experiences

## Contributing

UX Patterns evolve based on user research, usability testing, and product needs. When proposing new patterns or modifications, consider:

1. **User impact** - How does this improve the user experience?
2. **Consistency** - Does this align with existing patterns?
3. **Scalability** - Can this pattern work across different contexts?
4. **Accessibility** - Does this meet our accessibility standards?
