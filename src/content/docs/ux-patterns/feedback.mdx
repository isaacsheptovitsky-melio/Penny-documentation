Use [Section Banner's](https://zeroheight.com/98bb1df01/p/46d766) Compact variant to surface errors and validation summaries where they're most discoverable and actionable.

## Global feedback

For important issues that impact the entire screen or process, position the message at the top of the screen, interrupting the user's flow and demanding immediate attention.

## Local feedback

<Aside type="note">
Global placement is the standard for most use cases. However, use Local placement when an action is isolated to a specific section and keeping the feedback near the trigger provides necessary context.
</Aside>

Positioned directly above the section or element where the issue occurs, in order to highlight a localized issue within a specific section, field, or action on the page.

## Form validation

Form validation ensures data accuracy and integrity through two distinct stages: validating the input format (client-side) and validating the data quality (server-side).

![Form validation flow](/Penny-documentation/ux-patterns/feedback/feedback-flow.png)
**Once a form is submitted it is being validated both on input format, and the data in quality**

### Client-Side validation

This validation occurs locally in the browser before data is sent to the server.

* **When to use:** Use this for feedback on required fields or formatting errors (e.g., an incomplete routing number or a missing vendor name).
* **Behavior:** Since the input is technically incorrect, the request is not sent to the server.
* **Visual style:** Display these errors using the **Critical state** of the specific Form Field component.

![Client-side validation example](/Penny-documentation/ux-patterns/feedback/validation-example-1.png)
**Upon submission, the Vendor name and Bill amount fields are flagged as invalid because they are required but were left empty**

### Server-Side validation

This validation occurs after the user **successfully** submits the form and the server processes the data to verify its validity.

* **When to use:** Use this when the data format is correct, but the content causes a system error (e.g., the vendor already exists or the payment amount exceeds the limit)
* **Behavior:** The server returns a validation response indicating issues with the data
* **Visual style:** Display these errors using a **Section Banner** at the top of the form context.

### Validation logic & placement

Follow this order of operations to ensure a smooth user experience:

1. **Validate fields first:** Upon submission, check for client-side formatting issues first. Highlight these using the input's critical state to alert the user to specific fields that need attention.
2. **Validate data second:** Once the form is successfully submitted to the server, display any resulting errors.
3. **Banner placement:**
   * Use a **Section Banner** to summarize the server-side errors
   * Place the banner directly above the form heading
   * If there are multiple issues, consolidate them into a single banner list to avoid clutter

<Aside type="tip">
Avoid showing more than one banner per section—especially of the same type (e.g., multiple critical banners)
</Aside>

## Actions and dismissal

* Include an **action or an explanation** when the user must resolve the error
* Typically, do **not** allow dismissal for critical errors or when an action is required; dismissal is appropriate only when the message is not critical and no action is needed
