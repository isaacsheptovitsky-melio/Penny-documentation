Users can delete existing resources.

**Preventing accidental deletions:** To prevent unintended data loss, all destructive actions (e.g., "Delete vendor," "Delete bill") must include another confirmation step.

**Confirmation friction:** This confirmation step uses a **[Modal](/components/containers/modal)**, is to add friction, ensuring the user verifies their intent before an irreversible action is processed.

## How to best implement

### Resource

Position deletion triggers as an action to a row. Always trigger a confirmation modal upon selection to prevent accidental data loss.

Position deletion triggers within the drawer's footer menu. Always trigger a confirmation modal upon selection to prevent accidental data loss.
